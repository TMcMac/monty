## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables

### [0. push, pall]
* Implement the push and pall opcodes.
* The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
* The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.


### [1. pint]
* Implement the pint opcode.
* The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

### [2. pop]
* Implement the pop opcode.
* The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.


### [3. swap]
* Implement the swap opcode.
* The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.


### [4. add]
* Implement the add opcode.
*The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.


### [5. nop]
* Implement the nop opcode.
* The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.


### [6. sub]
* Implement the sub opcode.
* The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.


### [7. div]
* Implement the div opcode.
* The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.


### [8. mul]
* Implement the mul opcode.
* The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.


### [9. mod]
* Implement the mod opcode.
* The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.


### [10. comments]
* Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).


### [16. Holberton](./bf/1000-holberton.bf)
* Write a Brainf*ck script that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.


### [17. Add two digits](./bf/1001-holberton.bf)
* Add two digits given by the user.
* Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result
* The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)
